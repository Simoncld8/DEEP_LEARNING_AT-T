# DEEP_LEARNING_PROJET_AT&T

## Description

One of the main pain point that AT&T users are facing is constant exposure to SPAM messages.

AT&T has been able to manually flag spam messages for a time, but they are looking for an automated way of detecting spams to protect their users.

## Goals
the goal is to build a spam detector, that can automatically flag spams as they come based solely on the sms' content. 

## Dataset
The dataset is called spam.csv

## Content
The project is organized into four main parts, each focusing on a specific aspect:

1. **Initial explorations** of the data present in the dataset

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing** 

3. **Models training** 
    a) Simple RNN
    b) GRU
    c) LSTM
    d) LSTM with Attention

4. **Performances analysis**

All the models and their training histories can be found in the corresponding directory.

## Usage

To utilize and explore this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   git clone https://github.com/Simoncld8/DEEP_LEARNING_AT-T.git

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   pip install -r requirements.txt  

3. **Run the Analysis:**

   You will find all the analysis in the Jupyter Notebook provided (`Projet_AT_T.ipynb`).
